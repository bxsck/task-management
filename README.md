# Pre-Word Assignment Project

Hi SWIPE team,

This is the README for the **Pre-Word Assignment Project**. Below is the overview of the project, including implemented features and important notes.

---

## Notes

- The Front-end may not directly call the provided API, as the API was developed alongside the front-end.
- Instead, a custom API built for this assignment is being used.

---

## Features

### Authentication

- **Register**: Create a new user account.
- **Login**: Authenticate users to access their to-do lists.

### Todo Dashboard

- Display a dashboard for managing tasks with the following capabilities:
  - **Tab Filters**: Three filters to organize tasks by specific criteria.
  - **Grouped by Date**: To-do tasks are grouped based on their respective dates.
  - **Infinite Scrolling**: Tasks load dynamically as you scroll, enhancing user experience.
  - **Loading Skeleton**: Displays a skeleton screen while tasks are being fetched.
  - **Delete Tasks**: Remove specific to-do items from the list.

### Limitations

- **"Back to Top" Feature**: Not included due to current implementation struggles with Next.js 15 SSR. May be fixed in future updates.
